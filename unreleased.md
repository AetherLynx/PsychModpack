###### This is the changelog for a version that hasn't been released.
#### Psych Modpack v1.4

- Added Skip Intro option to Atrocity
- Now if you press up in the options menu at the top it will take you to the latest option, and if you're on the
  latest and press down, it will take you to the first, instead of not doing anything
- Re-Organized the hud so it doesn't cover your view (both middlescroll and downscroll)
- Now you can restart a song with R if you're on the results screen.
- Middlescroll and Downscroll are now supported.
- Added a basic rating system to the end screen. (Currently based on misses only)
- Removed the opponent's random ratings because it wasn't useful (this also removes the health drain but that can be enabled in settings.)
- Disabled the rating's scaling/tween on score pop-up
- Added mechanics for Week 1 indie cross (this took me 5 hours help) = Cuphead Blue Pellets Mechanic, Parry Note, Green Pellets Mechanic, Dodge Mechanic
- Reworked entirety of the Settings system, fixing many bugs and crashes, cleaned code and shit.
- Fixed game crashing when loading a song if the user hasn't entered settings menu, instead a Warning will display.
- Changed menu background and sounds to Indie Cross'.
- Deleted many leftover assets, songs, and data. **(File size went from 2.73gb to 2.05 lol)**
- Story mode re-enabled, now it doesn't crash when entering, and you can play vanilla songs.
