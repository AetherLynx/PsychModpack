###### This is the changelog for a version that hasn't been released.
#### Psych Modpack v1.4

- Added Skip Intro option to Atrocity
- Now if you press up in the options menu at the top it will take you to the latest option, and if you're on the
  latest and press down, it will take you to the first, instead of not doing anything
- ~Lun29 | Some hud elements now become more transparent if it's your turn.~ **Re-Organized the hud so it doesn't cover your view (both middlescroll and downscroll), thus removing this.**
- Lun29 | Now you can restart a song with R if you're on the results screen.
- Lun29 | The following settings are now forced: 
```haxe
- Zoom Score Text on Hit = OFF
- Camera Zooms = OFF
```
**- Middlescroll and Downscroll are now supported.**
**- Added a "Start Screen" or "Fake Loading Screen" that displays random tips.**
#### Bugfixes
- Fixed options menu triggering the previous **Crash when entering and Settings not working** glitch when pressing R without changing any option
- Settings now save even if you didn't change any setting, because it triggered other bugs
**- Fixed bugs with Middlescroll and Downscroll**
